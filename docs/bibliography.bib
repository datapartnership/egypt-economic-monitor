    abstract = {We present the geoBoundaries Global Administrative Database (geoBoundaries): an online, open license resource of the geographic boundaries of political administrative divisions (i.e., state, county). Contrasted to other resources geoBoundaries (1) provides detailed information on the legal open license for every boundary in the repository, and (2) focuses on provisioning highly precise boundary data to support accurate, replicable scientific inquiry. Further, all data is released in a structured form, allowing for the integration of geoBoundaries with large-scale computational workflows. Our database has records for every country around the world, with up to 5 levels of administrative hierarchy. The database is accessible at http://www.geoboundaries.org, and a static version is archived on the Harvard Dataverse.},

  abstract={Improving human well-being is increasingly recognized as essential for movement toward a sustainable and desirable future. Estimates of different aspects of human well-being, such as Gross Domestic Product, or percentage of population with access to electric power, or measuring the distribution of income in society are often fraught with problems. There are few standardized methods of data collection; in addition, the required data is not obtained in a reliable manner and on a repetitive basis in many parts of the world. Consequently, inter-comparability of the data that does exist becomes problematic. Data derived from nighttime satellite imagery has helped develop various globally consistent proxy measures of human well-being at the gridded, sub-national, and national level. We review several ways in which nighttime satellite imagery has been used to measure the human well-being within nations.},

abstract={The challenge of nowcasting the effect of natural hazard events (e.g., earthquakes, floods, hurricanes) on assets, people and society is of primary importance for assessing the ability of such systems to recover from extreme events. Traditional recovery estimates, such as surveys and interviews, are usually costly, time consuming and do not scale. Here we present a methodology to indirectly estimate the post-emergency recovery status (downtime) of small businesses in urban areas looking at their online posting activity on social media. Analysing the time series of posts before and after an event, we quantify the downtime of small businesses for three natural hazard events occurred in Nepal, Puerto Rico and Mexico. A convenient and reliable method for nowcasting the post-emergency recovery status of economic activities could help local governments and decision makers to better target their interventions and distribute the available resources more effectively.},

  abstract = "Many critical policy decisions, from strategic investments to the
              allocation of humanitarian aid, rely on data about the geographic
              distribution of wealth and poverty. Yet many poverty maps are out
              of date or exist only at very coarse levels of granularity. Here
              we develop microestimates of the relative wealth and poverty of
              the populated surface of all 135 low- and middle-income countries
              (LMICs) at 2.4 km resolution. The estimates are built by applying
              machine-learning algorithms to vast and heterogeneous data from
              satellites, mobile phone networks, and topographic maps, as well
              as aggregated and deidentified connectivity data from Facebook.
              We train and calibrate the estimates using nationally
              representative household survey data from 56 LMICs and then
              validate their accuracy using four independent sources of
              household survey data from 18 countries. We also provide
              confidence intervals for each microestimate to facilitate
              responsible downstream use. These estimates are provided free for
              public use in the hope that they enable targeted policy response
              to the COVID-19 pandemic, provide the foundation for insights
              into the causes and consequences of economic development and
              growth, and promote responsible policymaking in support of
              sustainable development.",
