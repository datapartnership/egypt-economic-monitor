# Spatial Inequality in Egypt

The Egypt country economics team is investigating spatial inequality. To support this work, the Lab is exploring the following alternative datasets -

1. Meta High Resolution Population Density
2. Meta Relative Wealth Index
3. Ookla Internet Speed
4. Amenities from OpenStreetMap
5. Facebook Future of Business Survey (2019-2021)
6. Facebook Business Activity Trends (2020-2022)

Each of these datasets and the methodology used to obtain them are elucidated in subsequent notebooks (or "chapters").
