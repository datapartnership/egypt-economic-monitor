# Foundational Datasets, Data Products, & Sample Indicators

## Foundational Datasets

**Foundational Datasets** refer to **all** datasets used in the analytics prepared for a project. The Foundational Datasets table includes a description of the data and their update frequency, as well as access links and contact information for questions about use and access. Users should not require any datasets not included in this table to complete the analytical work for the Data Good.

Following is list of all Foundational Datasets used in this Data Good:

**Data Products** are produced using the **Foundational Datasets** and can be further used to generate indicators and insights. All Data Products include documentation, references to original data sources (and/or information on how to access them), and a description of their limitations.

Following is a summary of Data Products used in this Data Good:

## Sample Indicators

**Indicators** can be derived from a combination of **Foundational Datasets** and **Data Products**. By combining Foundational Datasets and Data Products, teams can, on-demand, develop a large array of indicators to meet their project needs. Indicators can presented side-by-side in an Excel workbook -- a format that is generally accessible to the widest audiences.  Because all indicators are based on the same underlying data, they are comparable with each other, across geographies and across time.

For this project, sample indicators have been derived and aggregated at the governorate level and by year, to show changing trends in each governorate over time.
