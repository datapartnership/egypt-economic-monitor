# Analysing Business Activity Trends in Egypt

[Business Activity Trends](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/dfg/tools/business-activity-trends#methodology) are a crisis-triggered dataset released by Meta. The dataset is relesed at a national level. [GADM shpefiles](https://gadm.org/) are slightly different from the official shapefiles used in this project from [HdX, UNOCHA](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ab-tur). COVID-19 triggered dataset is used in this analysis. 

Business Activity Trends During Crisis uses data about posting activity on Facebook to measure how local businesses are affected by and recover from crisis events. Given the broad presence of small businesses on the Facebook platform, this dataset aims to provide timely estimates of global business activity without the common limitations of traditional data collection methods, such as scale, speed and nonstandardization. This is a crisis-triggered dataset i.e., it has been created by Meta to support humanitarian relief for post COVID in Egypt. Details about this dataset can be found on [Meta's Data For Good page](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/dfg/tools/business-activity-trends). 

The Business Activity Trends dataset was provided by [Meta](https://dataforgood.facebook.com/dfg/tools/business-activity-trends) through the proposal [Egypt Country Economic Monitor](https://portal.datapartnership.org/readableproposal/427) of the [Development Data Partnership](https://datapartnership.org). The data consisted of daily business activity quantile information at a GADM 2 level broken down by business vertical. Each cell (row) of the dataset contains data on the daily activity within a polygon-vertical combination. 

**The COVID-19 triggered Business Activity Trends dataset contains daily data from March 1, 2020 to Nov 29, 2022 at the national level. Activity quantile is used to measure the business activity trends in this dataset.**
